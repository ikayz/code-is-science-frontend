# Code is Science - Journal Policy Tracker Frontend

## Introduction

The Code is Science website (Frontend) allows users to view, read, sign up, and submit journals for code-sharing policy tracking. The website integrates with a python backend which does the processing of all the journals and user management.

The project targets the following types of users: editors, coders, code author, reviewers that are part of the Code is Science [persona](https://github.com/codeisscience/journal-policy-tracker-frontend/blob/master/assets/Code%20is%20Science%20-%20Persona.pdf). Any user who falls in the mentioned category can use the project for checking journal policies, and/or contributing to the journal policy tracker.

## What I worked on

At the beginning of the project the Code is Science front end was powered by vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google forms for its backend and a static site generator Hugo. The code is science website frontend needed to be revamped and redesigned to a modern look and feel. The following are the things I worked on:

- Designed the front-end in Adobe XD
- Home/landing page in React and Bootstrap
- Manifesto page in React and Bootstrap
- Contact page in React and Bootstrap
- Journals page in React and Bootstrap
- Login page in React and Bootstrap
- Sign Up page in React and Bootstrap
- The Navigation and Footer components in React
- Integration of forms with the backend
- Routing the different components to the correct pages/routes
- Writing Tests

## Issue Tracker

## Future work

After GSoC is done, work will continue on the project. Some issues are still open and need fixing, these will be fixed to make sure the project is fully functional. The link below has those issues listed: [Issues · codeisscience/journal-policy-tracker-frontend (github.com)](https://github.com/codeisscience/journal-policy-tracker-frontend/issues)

The following will be worked on

- user dashboard will be created with functionality on user management
- Journal editing
- Journal deletion
- Journal publishing
- Refactor the code for efficiency and better performance
- Write more tests.

### Reflections and What went well

At the beginning of the project there were a number of issues to do with the frontend libraries used. I wanted to go with Tailwind CSS for CSS but due to running into dependency issues we decided to go with React Bootstrap as it worked seamlessly. The frontend dependency issues cost the project some time but I got the ball rolling and began working on the project.

The frontend was not fully completed according to my plan. With GSoC coming to an end we were supposed to have the frontend and backend fully integrated and working on all parts.

### Lessons learnt

I learnt that unforeseen events can havent and get in the way of progress. This has taught me to work smarter and more efficiently by asking for help when I&#39;m stuck or if there is an issue which some can track and fix. You do not have to chase perfection, focus on the important parts and fix everything else as you go.
